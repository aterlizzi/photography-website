    review: `I absolutely loved getting my photos done with Kaitlyn!! I’ve done about 5 or 6 shoots with her and have been so thrilled with the photos every single time. She never fails to make me laugh while I’m taking my pictures and she is super accommodating with locations. She is also incredible with telling you how to pose, which is super helpful and makes the pictures even better!!`,

    review: `Fulmore is a fantastic photographer– and I’m not just referring to her technical skill. She has a warm personality and vibrant sense of humor that make the shoot fun and natural. Plus she’s got a knack for artistry, so the pictures turn out to represent both your authentic self and her vision. Simply put: all pros and no cons here.`,
