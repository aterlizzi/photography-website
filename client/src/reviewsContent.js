    review: `I absolutely loved getting my photos done with Kaitlyn!! I’ve done about 5 or 6 shoots with her and have been so thrilled with the photos every single time. She never fails to make me laugh while I’m taking my pictures and she is super accommodating with locations, plus she knows some great spots if you’re stumped. She is also incredible with telling you how to pose, which is super helpful and makes the pictures even better!! Kaitlyn is such an amazing photographer and I would book with her again and again!`,

As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn't understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same.`,

While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future.`,

There was no time to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something important behind. Everything was thrown into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all.`,
